# CMP Feature Catalog — Licensed Features Reference

> What each licensed feature key includes, what capabilities it unlocks, and which pages/APIs are gated behind it.

## Overview

CMP uses feature keys in the license to control what capabilities are available. Each key maps to a set of UI pages, API endpoints, and functionality. This document explains exactly what each feature covers.

## How Feature Gating Works

### Two-Layer System

```
Feature Accessible = License Key Present AND Admin Toggle Enabled
```

1. **License layer:** The license file defines which feature keys are available
2. **Admin toggle layer:** Admins can additionally disable licensed features via Settings → Feature Toggles

Both must be true for a feature to be accessible.

### What Happens When a Feature is NOT Licensed

- **Frontend:** Feature is hidden from navigation (user never sees it)
- **API:** Returns HTTP 403: `"This feature requires a license upgrade. Contact your administrator."`
- **Feature toggle endpoint:** Reports the feature as `disabled`

### What Happens When a Feature IS Licensed but Admin-Disabled

- **Frontend:** Feature is hidden from navigation
- **API:** Returns HTTP 403 (same as unlicensed)
- **Difference:** Admin can re-enable it without a license change

---

## Always Available (Not Gated by License)

These features are always available regardless of license:

| Feature | Why |
|---------|-----|
| Dashboard | Core navigation |
| User management | Required for basic operation |
| Login/logout | Authentication |
| Profile | User self-service |
| Health endpoints | Monitoring |
| Resource inventory | Core functionality (viewing resources) |
| Resource actions | Day-2 operations on existing resources |
| Notifications | System alerts |
| Logging & Monitoring | Platform observability |

---

## For Vendors: How to Add a New Licensed Feature

1. Add the feature key to `backend/app/models/enterprise_config.py` → `SECRET_KEYS` or relevant list
2. Add the feature toggle in `backend/app/models/toggle_settings.py`
3. Gate the API endpoint with `Depends(require_licensed_feature("new_feature_key"))`
4. Gate the frontend nav item with `isFeatureEnabled('new_feature_key')`
5. Add to this document
6. Add to the license generation script's feature list
7. Update tier definitions (which tiers include it)

---

## For Customers: How to Check Your Licensed Features

```bash
# Via API
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  https://your-cmp.com/api/v1/license/status | jq .features_enabled

# Via UI
Login as admin → Administration → System → System Status → Licensed Features section
```
